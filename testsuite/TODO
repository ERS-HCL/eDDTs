eDDTs TODO
----------

cpu_core_test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The curent cpu core test only finds the number of cpu
cores available, instead a more expanded test would be 
verify each core using proc/sys interface

sensors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is not much sensor device driver test case available
apart from a temperature sensor. With IOT evolving in market,
test cases related to different kinds of sensors will help
for different projects

networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Test cases related to wireless networking including wi-fi &
bluetooth shall be added

Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Display devices and touchscreen test cases should also be 
added

Common test case layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently some test cases are duplicated in each platforms
.It would be more ideal , if a common test case layer can be created
to support multiple platforms .

User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The test suite now assumes the device under test will have a serial console
interface to execute the test cases. A minimal GUI with test execution , reporting
and supporting different interface would be a better way to execute the testing
